# Particles Simulation (WIP)

[Start](https://denv3rr.github.io/particles/)

## Features
- 2D lattice simulation with temperature, bonding, and gravity controls.
- 3D renderer with orbit, pan, and zoom controls (desktop).
- Fluid (SPH) mode with viscosity, compressibility, surface tension, and velocity smoothing.
- Gas volumetrics at far zoom for cloud-like formations.
- Fluid tracers to visualize flow paths.
- Adaptive particle count and mobile-friendly defaults.

## Controls
- Drag: orbit (3D) or inject heat (2D).
- Shift + drag: inject heat in 3D.
- Mouse wheel / pinch: zoom in 3D.
- Right/middle drag or two-finger drag: pan in 3D.
- Arrow keys: rotate camera; WASD: pan; +/-: zoom.
